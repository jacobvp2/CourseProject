# CourseProject

Final Project for CS410. For our final project, we attempted to reproduce results from the (contexual text mining) research paper listed below:

ChengXiang Zhai, Atulya Velivelli, and Bei Yu. 2004. A cross-collection mixture model for comparative text mining. In Proceedings of the 10th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD 2004). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 743-748. DOI=10.1145/1014052.1014150

We used similar data on the same topics as used in the research paper. The data used can be seen in the data folder.
