# CS410 Course Project Team GOAT

## Background ## 
Reproducing a Paper. For our final project, we attempted to reproduce results from the (contexual text mining) research paper listed below:

ChengXiang Zhai, Atulya Velivelli, and Bei Yu. 2004. A cross-collection mixture model for comparative text mining. In Proceedings of the 10th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD 2004). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 743-748. DOI=10.1145/1014052.1014150

The actual paper has been included in our repository for your own reference. 

## Setup/Dependencies ## 

## Data ## 
Our data is rather fluid in this case. We have an example of our demonstration video in a youtube link [here][youtube.com]. In an attempt to keep the data as similar to the original paper.
